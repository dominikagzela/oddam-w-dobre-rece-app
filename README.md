# HelpHand - charity app

## Description:
The application was created for all users to check its purpose and contact the creators. Users who decide to donate their unneeded items to trusted institutions can create an account, fill out a form (what and how many items they want to donate, select the appropriate institution and provide the address and date of receipt of the item by the courier). Users can view past and upcoming donated gifts. In addition, the fundraise organizer can log in to the application and manage institutions and donations in the administration panel

## What is the idea?
The aim of the project is to create a place where everyone will be able to give away unnecessary things to trusted institutions.

## What problem does it solve?
You have things at home that you want to get rid of, but don't know how. There are many solutions available, but many require extra effort or are not trusted. You have to go to verified places, and there is no time for it / there is no way to go there, and containers under the house or local collections are unverified and it is not known whether these things will actually go to those in need.
